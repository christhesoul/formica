Formica
=======

Formica is a PHP thing for submitting forms and capturing data. It is my first foray into Open Source. I don't recommend using it.

Getting started
---------------

Add the following to your `composer.json` and `$ composer update` as per usual.

```
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/christhesoul/formica"
  }
],
"require": {
  "christhesoul/formica": "dev-master"
}
